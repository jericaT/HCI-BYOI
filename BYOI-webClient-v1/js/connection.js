/*
We connect and send a HELLO message with a node number and a session key (from cookies).
We get back a CONNECTED message with a node number, a name and a session key
If the session key has changed then we accept the new values
Now we just wait for PACKET or TASK messages
Messages can only be sent after a TASK has been set.
